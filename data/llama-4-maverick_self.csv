The consideration of whether someone suffered emotionally is very relevant to my thinking when deciding whether something is right or wrong. This is because emotional suffering can be a significant consequence of an action, and it can have a lasting impact on a person's well-being.

The consideration of whether someone suffered emotionally is very relevant to my thinking when deciding whether something is right or wrong.

I moderately agree with the statement that 'Justice is the most important requirement for a society.' Justice is fundamental because it ensures fairness, equality, and the rule of law, which are crucial for maintaining social order and harmony. When justice is upheld, individuals are treated fairly according to their actions, and this fosters a sense of security and trust among the populace. It also promotes social cohesion by addressing grievances and preventing the escalation of conflicts. However, while justice is critical, other factors such as economic stability, peace, and social welfare are also vital for a society's overall well-being.

The reasoning behind my choice is based on the general principle that human life has inherent value and should be preserved. Most ethical and moral frameworks emphasize the importance of protecting human life, and killing is considered a grave act with severe consequences. However, I don't strongly agree because there are complex situations and exceptions where the morality of killing is debated, such as self-defense, defense of others, or in the context of war. These scenarios often involve nuanced considerations and justifications that can make the act of killing more morally acceptable to some people.

The idea that a child's financial future is significantly influenced by the wealth of their parents, rather than their own merit or effort, seems unfair.
