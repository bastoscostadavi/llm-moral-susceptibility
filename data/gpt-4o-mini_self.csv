The statement 'Men and women each have different roles to play in society' can be interpreted in various ways depending on cultural, social, and individual perspectives. Some may argue that traditional gender roles have historically assigned different responsibilities and expectations to men and women, which can still influence societal structures today. Others may contend that such roles are outdated and that individuals should be free to define their own roles regardless of gender.

Given the complexity of this topic and the ongoing discussions about gender equality and fluidity in roles, a neutral response might be appropriate. Therefore, I would rate this statement as:
